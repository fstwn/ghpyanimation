# GhPyAnimation

*GhPyAnimation* is a simple animation toolkit for [Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper) implemented using the [GhPython](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/ghpython-component/) scriptable component.

It was written for the *Digital Workflow* seminars which were conducted in summer 2019 and summer 2020 at [Kunsthochschule Kassel](https://kunsthochschulekassel.de).

## Purpose & Origins

The toolkit draws heavily on the ideas of the [Animation plug-in](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/animation) by Yue & Zongzi.

**So, if it's already available in some form, why rewrite it??**  
There are actually several reasons for this:
- I am a nerd and I like full control.
- I think there should be a lot more open-source software.
- It's a great way to teach the basic concepts of coding Python inside Rhinoceros / Grasshopper.
